## üìù Self-Evaluation

**Reflection**: 
The creation of the frontend application in React with Next.js provided me with a new knowledge and skills on the technologies such as Redux state management, Next.js, Axios, and React itself.
Some time was spent in order to learn the technology, as I had no prior experience working with this technology stack. 
The main outcome of the course is a gained skill to create a frontend application from scratch. the gained skills will be heavily used within my daily work. 

## Getting Started with development

To install libraries run:
```bash
npm install
```

To run development server run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel.
